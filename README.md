Unit 18 PWA Homework: Online/Offline Budget Trackers

Update code to add functionality to our existing Budget Tracker application to allow for offline access and increased functionality for our app.

The user will be able to subract expenses and add deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.

Functionality while the app is offline:

- User has the ability to enter deposits while the app is offline.

- Enter expenses while the app is offline.

When brought back online:

- The offline entries should now be added to the budget tracker.

User Story:

As an avid traveller I want to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data or an internet connection SO THAT my account balance is accurate while I am traveling.

Business Context:

This app gives users a fast and easy way to track their money but also allows them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success.

Acceptance Criteria:

Given the user is on our budget app without an internet connection when the user inputs a withdrawal or deposit then that will be shown on the page, and added to their transaction history when their connection is back online.
